## ⚡ EV Charging Optimization Agent

🚀 An intelligent AI agent designed to optimize EV charging stations by balancing **throughput, congestion, and system stability** in real-time.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Maximize EV charging throughput while minimizing:

* 🚗 Waiting queues
* ⚡ Power overload
* ⏱️ Charging delays

---

## 🧠 Core Idea

Instead of using fixed rules, this system:

✔ Evaluates multiple actions at every step
✔ Adapts to real-time conditions
✔ Selects the best strategy dynamically

---

## ⚙️ Key Features

### 🔹 Multi-Action Decision Engine

* Simultaneously evaluates:

  * Pricing strategies
  * Power distribution
* Selects optimal action per timestep

### 🔹 Adaptive Load Handling

* Detects congestion (queue length)
* Adjusts pricing & power dynamically

### 🔹 Overload Control

* Penalizes unsafe power usage
* Stabilizes grid performance

### 🔹 Time-Aware Optimization

* Uses time-of-day factor (solar window)
* Encourages efficient energy usage

### 🔹 Explainable AI

* Provides reasoning behind decisions
* Improves transparency and trust

## 📊 Sample Output

```json
{
  "easy": 1.48,
  "medium": 0.92,
  "hard": 0.73
}
```

## 🔬 How It Works

### Step-by-Step:

1. Environment provides system state:

   * Queue length
   * Charger utilization
   * Waiting time
   * Overload level

2. Agent evaluates multiple actions:

   * Price levels (0–2)
   * Power modes (0–1)

3. Each action is scored based on:

   * Utilization efficiency
   * Queue reduction
   * Overload control
   * Time-based optimization

4. Best action is selected and applied

---

## 📈 Why This Stands Out

✔ Not rule-based — fully adaptive
✔ Handles real-world dynamic scenarios
✔ Balances efficiency + stability
✔ Works across all difficulty levels

## 🧪 API Endpoints (OpenEnv)

| Method | Endpoint  | Description       |
| ------ | --------- | ----------------- |
| GET    | `/health` | Health check      |
| POST   | `/reset`  | Reset environment |
| POST   | `/step`   | Perform action    |
| GET    | `/run`    | Run evaluation    |
